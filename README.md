# Rose :rose:

I hate package managers.

That's not true, I actually *love* them. They are one of the coolest
innovations to happen to OSes in the last thirty years. In fact, I'm kind of
a package management snob, having strong opinions about all of them, and
I'm super critical of each and every one.

That being said, working with them can really suck. If you're only ever faced
with one or two of them, you might be fine. But having to use a large number
of them frequently can be a pain. The context switch that has to happen when
moving from one package manager to another is always problematic. Why can't
they all behave the same? Why can't they all be interfaced the same? Why does
every one do things a little bit or a lot different?

Rose aims to be a package manager unifier. It's a wrapper script that *should*
let you work with a number of package managers behind the scenes in a single,
unified way.
